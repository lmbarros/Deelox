# Deelox

You are probably not interested in this code :-)  This is just an ninspired implementation of the Lox programming language in [D](http://dlang.org).

More precisely, this is just me following Bob Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) and converting the code to D as I go (without trying to make it idiomatic D or anything).
